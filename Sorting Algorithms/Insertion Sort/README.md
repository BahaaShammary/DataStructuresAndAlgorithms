# Insertion Sort

Example use of Insertion Sort is to sort an array of items in increasing order. This array will contain items that are integers.
[5, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6] 
Sorting in this example means all items to the left of an item, are smaller than that item. 
Insertion Sort is not a fast sorting algorithm because it uses nested loops to shift items into place. 
It is only used for small data sets.
It runs in O(n^2).
